# Discussion

As mentioned in the PR, a good portion of the UX and styling work was AI-assisted. I prioritized core functionality and
performance (paging, sorting, and backend filtering) over UI/UX polish. By the time I got to the design phase, I had
already spent close to the suggested 2 hour limit.

To quickly improve the user experience, I used a vibe-coding approach, leaning on AI to help translate basic layout
needs into a more polished, user-friendly interface. If I had more time, I would have taken the opportunity to get
familiar with Tailwind or implement another styling framework myself.

## Additional changes I would have made

- Include unit and integration tests
- Refactor `page.tsx` to use helper functions and smaller components (e.g. table row)
- Make phone numbers tappable on mobile
- Add basic accessibility improvements
